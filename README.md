The program: Unlimited 6-sided dice
• Ask the user for a choice of how many dice are to be thrown and receive that information when pressed. At least 1 and a maximum of 4 dice shall be chosen by the user.
• The program slumps results for each single dice, one at a time, and prints it on the screen along with the sum of the dice hit so far.
